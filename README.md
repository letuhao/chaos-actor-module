# Actor Module Skeleton

This is a **skeleton-only** definition of the Actor Module project structure.
- No classes or interfaces yet — those will be defined in later design docs.
- Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).

## Structure
- docs/ — design and API documentation
- packages/ — core libraries (stats, combat, conversion, SPI, cultivation examples)
- apps/ — zone server and tools (sim-cli)
